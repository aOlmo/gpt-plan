Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.

Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.

Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.

How to make english country scones.
Preheat oven to 425F.
Line the baking sheet with some parchment paper.
Sift into a bowl the baking soda salt cream of tartar and 2 cups flour.
Cut the butter into the mixture until it gains the consistency of bread crumbs.
Mix in the sugar and about a half cup of milk to form a soft dough.
Feel free to use a little less or more milk to prevent the dough from being too stiff or watery.
Put some flour on a clean flat surface and transfer the dough there.
Knead the dough gently with rolling pin flattening it to about 0.75 inches thick.
Using a glass or a dough cutter cut 2-inch circles from the dough.
This should yield around 12 pieces.
Place the dough slices onto the baking sheet.
Make sure to leave about 2 inches space around each slice.
This gives the dough enough room to expand slightly during baking.
Brush each dough slice with milk.
Bake the dough slices at 425F for 10 minutes.
Once your scones are done cool them briefly on wire rack.

Aim for a unique pose with a few other characters such as Santa and his sleigh with the reindeer or even with the elves.
For a bit of humor you can try putting in a Santa design just as he s climbing into the chimney head first.
Some parents choose to simply put Santa s sleigh on top and load it with treats and candies for the kids or strawberries for the adults.
Frosty the Snowman.
Frosty the Snowman would be a great topping for a snow white carrot flavored cake.
Use light colored M Ms as snowflakes or simply use decorative icings.
Offset the snow white design with bright orange for Frosty the Snowman s nose.
A traditional design for a traditional cake you can never go wrong with using a Christmas Tree for your centerpiece.
For this year try creating the tree from something edible as well perhaps with a dozen of strawberries candies or even carved fruit.
This should encourage kids to eat healthy for the holidays.
For a more grown up Christmas cake go for something simple yet elegant.
Use the combination of red and green to mimic the poinsettia flower against a backdrop of white laces frosting.
As a centerpiece you can try putting in mistletoe and kissing the person who gets the center piece.
Other Christmas Symbols.
If you find the above mentioned design ideas trite you can always opt for a different theme.
Christmas angels carolers or even the comical Grinch could be used for the perfect Christmas cake.
With a bit of imagination you can create something spectacular this Christmas.
You can even ask the kids for input or allow them to place the different decorations on the cake.
This way they will be able to enjoy the festive season more.
If you re choosing between different cake recipes it s a good idea to do some taste testing first.
Try creating these cakes in smaller batches and serving samplers for the family.

MAKE breakfast the night before with a hash brown casserole.
Start by mixing together your cream of mushroom condensed soup sour cream salt pepper onion and cheese in a large bowl.
After these are well combined add in the hash browns and mix gently.
Spray your slow cooker with some non-stick cooking spray or coat with butter.
This will prevent sticking so you don't have a huge mess to clean up.
Pour the hash brown mixture into your slow cooker and put the cover on.
Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for 1 to 1.5 hours.
After this turn the heat to low and leave it on for 2.5 hours longer.
Turn off slow cooker and serve right away.
Keep on warm if you plan on waiting to enjoy for a little bit longer.
It's best when served with scrambled eggs.
If you want to add something unique to this recipe add your favorite vegetables.
It's generally best to use soft vegetables or those that have been slightly cooked before you add them.
This will ensure they don't turn out hard when the rest of the dish is cooked fully.
Broccoli and cheese work well together but peppers also taste great.
You can also add in cooked sausage or bacon if you want some meat in the dish.
Just make sure that the meat you add is already cooked before it's put in.
If you add in raw meat it likely won't fully cook when the rest of the dish is done and may be raw.
This is a very forgiving recipe that you can play around with and change if you want to add or omit something.
You can do everything from adding in some garlic to switching the flavor of condensed soup you use.
