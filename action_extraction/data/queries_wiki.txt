Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.

Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.

If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.

Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.

You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.

If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.

Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.

Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.
Consider what you already know about them and ask them them questions about what they may want or need.
If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

If the parents have a more elegant taste go with something which matches that style like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme.
For a young and fun couple or a hipster style choose something like the mustache theme owls or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby.
The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents.
In this case choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake story books or toys.
Purchase or make your own centerpiece.
If you are able to find exactly what you need online visit the store or order it online in time to arrive before the date of your baby shower.
If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online or you would like to save some money and get creative buy the items you need and put them together yourself.
For instance if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself.
You can even adorn the top of the "cake" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer.
Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers.
Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them.
If you aren’t crafty consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you.
Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like.

Replace disposable air filters.
A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable” “permanent” andor “reusable” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters.
Avoid vacuuming them as well.
Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air.
At a low pressure this may work temporarily but it’s not a long-term solution.
Clean or replace your car air filter regularly.
Clean or change your filter every 12000 to 15000 miles or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.
Disposable filters should be replaced whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage ignition problems or fouled spark plugs.
Clean or replace your home air filter routinely.
Clean or change your filter every three months and more frequently in-season.
Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.
If your filter is disposable replace it.
If it’s reusable you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

Decide on a theme.
Figure out what you would like the theme of the baby shower to be.
Choosing a theme will help you be specific about what you are looking for in decorations and help you to narrow your search for a centerpiece.
Some sample themes for boys are cowboys sailors robots dragons pirates sports and little mustaches.
Themes for girls may include butterflies princess flowersand tea parties.
Non-gendered themes could be teddy bears rubber duckies story books owls birds in a nest sweet peas or puzzles.
Research your options.
Consider all of the possibilities for a centerpiece using your theme then look around for options which best meet your needs abilities and budget.
Look online and ask around about different types of centerpieces.
Some options could include A “cake” made of diapers.
A bouquet of flowers or balloons.
Floating candles or rubber duckies.
Building blocks and stuffed animals.
Ask the parents for input.
Ultimately you want the centerpiece to appeal and perhaps even be useful to the parents-to-be.

Use evergreen branches.
If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door.
If you live in an urban area you can purchase artificial branches or if you have access to trees snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.
Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door.
If you like tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.
Hang lettering on your door.
If you’d like to spell out a word on your door you can purchase large wooden letters at a local craft-supply store.
Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas or in blue and white for a wintery look.
Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.
Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word “JOY” or “THANKS” If you’d like to spell a longer word—eg.
“CHRISTMAS” “NEW YEAR” or “GOD BLESS” purchase smaller letters.
Decorate with ornaments.
If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door.
Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa.
If you’d like something simpler hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob.
A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door use a small number of ornaments probably three or fewer.
You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations for example homemade ornaments or snowflakes.
Incorporate natural decorations.
If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration plan to shy away from ornaments which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations.
Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper) pinecones holly or mistletoe.
Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.
Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year.
Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.
